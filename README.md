# MyGraduationFinalPaper
This is my Graduation Final Paper in Automation Engineering at Federal University of Itajub√°. It was about Demand and Stock Forecasting using Advanced Analytics Approaches in a company that I realized my first internship. Unfortunately the data and the results are codified. In addition this scripts have my article in portuguese(BR) language.  I used the machine learning Random Forest Regressor to predict the sales and had compared them with the classical statistical methods called ARIMA and MA models. The scripts don't have markdown explanations, because all the relevants results were put in the article. The references used in the article and in the codes is available in final of article.
